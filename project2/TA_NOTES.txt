Simulating a medium.
Generation is the same as previous project. (Poisson?)
Keep nodes and medium seperate.
bit times to tick times
dont need a desitination in the frames, as everyone will get the packet anyways <-- we could keep a track of this inside the main tick loop, so we deqeue whenever the time elapses.
assume speed of ethernet.
need to keep a track of T_r? what..

1) need a signal for the frame (i think this is to indicate a node about the presence of a packet)
2) keep track of which node the frame/packet belongs to. (only removed when all nodes have received the packet).


sense/transmit:
case 1) non-persistant
        - always sense for 96 bit times.

case 2) p-persistant
        - below p
            - wait for random time.
            - then check
            - if still busy --> treat as a collision and use the backoff process.
            - if not busy then go back.
